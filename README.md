All aspects of the work have been implemented correctly.

There are 3 HTML files: index.html, resume.html, and bio.html that include the required content and pass the HTML5 specifications.

There is 1 CSS file with at least 5 rules that passes the official CSS validation.

The following were NOT used: frames, styling elements/attributes in the HTML, absolute URLS for images, front-end frameworks, other people's CSS files, or JavaScript.

All file names follow the guidelines and all content is stored in the following repo: eranal01.github.io.


I recieved help from Juliana (TA, thank you!!) on sublime issues. I discussed the GitHub and repo aspect of the assignment with Lena Chang in the early stages of development. I also used https://www.w3schools.com/howto often for help with the CSS. 


I spent approximalty 12 hours on this assignment.
